**Database Artifact Three**

The artifact I selected was for my second project for my CS-340 class. For this project I had to implement a basic RESTful web service using python it was created in August of 2020. 

I included this artifact because it shows my ability to take an existing program and convert it to a different programing language.

For modifying this artifact, I took the improved Python code and rewrote it in Java. I have also worked on improving the code by requiring credentials to make any changes. I learned that changing code to a new language is much more difficult than I initially assumed. This is because there is not a direct translation from one code to another and the process is closer to creating the program from scratch.
