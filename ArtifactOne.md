**Software Design and Engineering Artifact One**

The artifact I selected was for my final project in CS-330. The artifact is a 3d representation of a bookcase. It was created in December of 2020. 

I included this artifact because it shows my ability to create a 3d object that is digitally lit, fully textured and the user has the ability to orbit with mouse controls. It also shows my ability to have different textured objects in the world and my ability to have one be animated while the other remains static. 

The goal is for the artifact to be improved by adding another object(pyramid) on a shelf in the bookcase and this object has a different texture from the bookcase and is animated. One of the first challenges I faced was that I could not run the code because I did not have eclipse or my computer setup to run OpenGL. While working to set up Eclipse I wrote out the code in Notepad and learned that I have improved in writing out code without having to continuously check it for errors.
