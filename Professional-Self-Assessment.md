**Professional Self-Assessment**

Throughout my time in the computer science program and my final capstone class I learned many important skills that are needed in the computer science field.
I found that my course work emphasized on learning the best practices, understanding the logic when writing code and on building finished projects. I was taught that writing code was not an
  after thought but that there was a deliberate reason for choosing the code you wrote. All my courses required a final assignment that incorporated everything learned 
  throughout the class, this gave a hands on experience in taking an idea for a program to a finished a program. 
  
**Collaborating in a Team Environment**

There were many classes in my computer science program that required me to work on projects with a team. At first it was only small projects that required the
 team to worktogether on an assignment for a week and as I progressed through the program my CS-310 required an in depth understanding on how teams work together on a project. The first 
  half of this class taught us the fundamentals of collaborating on a project. I learned the importance of version control and cloning repositories so I could work on my part of 
  the project without affecting the main code of the assignment. After completing each part of the assignment, the code was committed to a git repository where other students 
  looked at and commented on any errors. After updating the code, it was then merged with the original repository. This class gave a hands-on experience with working with both a 
  team to complete a project and working with programs that are used in the field.
  
**Communicating to Stakeholders**

The focus in my CS-250 class was to take on various roles from the agile method this includes the role as a product owner. As the product owner I had to communicate to 
 stakeholders and explain how the project was progressing, explain the timeline for the project and set the priorities. I learned the best way to communicate with stakeholders 
 and how to explain projects both for people who had an understanding of computer science and those who did not.  
  
**Data Structures and Algorithms**

Multiple classes in my program focused on data structures and algorithms. We first began by understanding the fundamentals and then started incorporating the ideas into writing code for programs. The artifact I have chosen demonstrates my abilities in data structures and algorithms Software Engineering and Database. Software engineering and databases was one of the focuses in my program. In multiple classes we were required to build databases in python or create software in java. The artifact I have chosen demonstrates my abilities in software engineering and databases.
  
**Security**

  Through out my program security was one of my main focuses. I studied ways to write code that aligned with defensive programing. I took extra classes on ethical hacking so I 
 can understand the best practices for secure coding. I also learned how human error can cause many vulnerabilities and I used this knowledge to enhance my artifact accordingly. 

**Artifact Summary**

For the Software Design and Engineering portion I chose to improve the software. For the Algorithms and Data Structure portion I chose to improve the efficiency of the artifact. For the Database portion I chose to add more advanced concepts of MySQl to enhance the artifact. The artifact I chose is from my CS-340 class where I had to implement a basic RESTful web service using Python. The artifact showcases my ability to code in python and to implement a basic RESTful web service using Python.
