**Professional Self-Assessment**
	Throughout my computer science program and my final capstone class at SNHU I learned important skills that are needed and required in the computer science field. I found that my course work emphasized on learning the best practices, understanding the logic when writing code and on building finished projects.  I was taught that writing code was not an
  after thought but that there was a deliberate reason for choosing the code you wrote. All my courses emphasized  hands on experience when taking an idea to a finished  program. 


**Collaborating in a Team Environment**

  There were many classes in my computer science program that emphasized the importance of working with a team and creating comments and code that were easily readable and understandable to the team. My CS-310 required a collaborative environment as the class worked together to create a completed program. The class went through the process of cloning, committing, updating, and then merging repositories. This class gave a hands-on experience in collaborating in a team environment and using programs used in the field to complete a project. 
  
**Communicating to Stakeholders**

  In my CS-250 class we learned about the lifecycle of developing software while using the Agile method. We took on each role in the developmental cycle to understand what is required from each role. This was useful in understanding how to effectively communicate where in the process the project was to the team as well as being able to communicate with stakeholders. We were to take the feedback received to further improve and update the project until complete and then create a maintenance plan for the company. I used the knowledge gained in this class when developing this final project. I was able to create a schedule and follow the agile software development cycle when working on the project. This allowed me to have the time to adapt the project if errors were found or I needed to incorporate feedback. 

**Data Structures and Algorithms**

  The focus of my CS-260 class was data structures and algorithms. I learned the importance of creating data structures and algorithms and that without them programs would not function effectively. Data structures allow for an organized access to data which allows for code to be efficient, structured and simplified. Having the fundamentals of this class was helpful when developing code for my more advanced classes. I was able to use the ideas of logic and structure in the class when working on different projects. 
  
**Software Engineering and Database**

In my CS-250 class we learned about Software Engineering and in my CS-310 we expanded our knowledge of software engineering my working with a group to complete our projects. Many classes focused on testing the code created and how to create and run Junit tests.
  
**Security**

  While I did not take a Security specific class in SNHU I did study Security and Ethical hacking from TestOut. The Ethical hacking course explained the vulnerabilities that are created and exploited by hackers and taught the counter measures needed to correct them. I used the skills learned to improve Artifact three by creating the need to fill in credentials when trying to make changes to the data and required the program to check for existing files before accessing them.

**Artifact Summary**

The three artifacts I have chosen show a wide range of abilities I have developed in my computer science program. The three artifacts show my ability to write code in C++, Python and Java. Artifact one shows my ability to create both static and animated 3d objects. Artifact two shows my ability to take prewritten python code and improve the efficiency of the code. The third artifact shows my ability to translate code from Python to Java. I have chosen these three artifacts because each one represents my interest in the computer science field.
