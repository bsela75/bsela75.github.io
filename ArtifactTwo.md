**Algorithm and Data Structures Artifact Two**


The artifact I selected was for my second project for my CS-340 class. For this project I had to implement a basic RESTful web service using python it was created in August of 2020. 

I included this artifact because it shows my ability to code in python and the ability to take prewritten code and improve the efficiency of the code.  

When I completed my CS-340 class I continued to work on improving my skills in python and this was useful when working on the enhancements for this artifact. The artifact was completely changed from the original. I first started by changing the structure of the code, so it was streamlined and consistent. The comments I added were more thorough and documented each section of the code. The code is written as concisely as I am currently able to.
