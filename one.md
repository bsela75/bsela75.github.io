**Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering**

For the Software Design and Engineering artifact I chose my milestone 2 assignment in CS-340. For this assignment I had to implement a basic RESTful web service using Python. It was created four months ago and was part of my final project.

I included this artifact in my ePortfolio because it showcases my ability to code in python and to implement a basic RESTful web service using Python. I also included this 
code because it showcases my improvements in writing comments and my ability to structure code.

After I had completed my CS-340 class I spent more time working with Python and learning the logic behind coding in Python. When improving this artifact, I learned that it takes practice to find the best way to code a program. While my initial code worked it did not follow the best practices for coding in python. I improved this code by structuring the code following pythonâ€™s best practices. I included detailed comments and more comments then the initial code. I improved the naming of variables and improved the if else statements.
